# Programming Camp 2018

Hello everyone!

I really enjoyed teaching all of you. It was quite fun, and everyone paid
attention well. Let me outline everything that we went over.

You learned about
* State machines
* Command based framework
* State machines vs Command based framework
* Autonomous configuration with JSON (the dashboard)
* PID
* Trapezoidal motion profiling
* Gyro pid
* How to run code on robotics simulations
* Computer vision
  * color filtering
  * HSV color wheel
  * contours and how to filter them
  * using the webcam
  * drawing text on the screen
* websites
  * HTML - the basic text structure of the webpage
  * CSS - what makes up the layout and design
  * Javascript - what animates the webpage and provides functionality

You experienced and wrote some code in the following languages:
* Python -- computer vision
* Java -- state machines
* Kotlin -- command framework
* Javascript -- website and simulator
* JSON -- dashboard
* HTML -- website
* CSS -- website

This may seem like a lot, well, because it is! I don't expect you to know or
remember most of this because it's hard and took me a while to know.

The purpose of this class wasn't to teach you a ton of boring, useful stuff, but
to motivate you into learning more on your own. This may have been easier with
me, but I taught myself all of this stuff over a few years and you can too. :)

I just wanted to show you the cool side of robotics programming, and the
possibilities of what you can do if you embrace the unknown and start learning
for yourself. 

Different languages, new concepts, and hard problems aren't a barrier when you
are a determined programmer and have access to the internet.

You can do it.

P.S. Feel free to contact me whenever about whatever. I don't mind at all, I
promise. Oh, and  here is the link to the code you all worked on:
